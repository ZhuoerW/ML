We refer to https://github.com/kamalkraj/Named-Entity-Recognition-with-Bidirectional-LSTM-CNNs while building the BiLSTM model and use the library from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/.

After downloading "glove.6B.100d.txt" from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/, put it in the same file with nn.py.

Enter >> python nn.py to run the BiLSTM-CNN model.

Enter >> python crf.py to run the CRF model.
